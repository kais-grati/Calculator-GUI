# 🧮 Calculator GUI

A simple and elegant **Python Calculator** built with [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/tomschimansky/customtkinter), providing a clean, modern look compared to the standard Tkinter widgets.  
This project was one of my first GUI applications in Python — showcasing basic arithmetic operations with a beautiful interface.
